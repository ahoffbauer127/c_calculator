# C Command-Line Calculator

## Overview
This project is a console based calculator application written in C.  It will initially be designed to perform basic
arithmetic operations, and maintain a history of recent calculations.  As a reach goal, I hope to add some more
scientific abilities to the calculator.  I am a graduating student at the University of British Columbia, and am
wanting to highlight and practice some of my programming skills as well as practice the fundamentals of project
planning, execution, and completion.  While the calculator itself might not pose much real world usage because
(ummmmm, your iphones calculator exists üòÖü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) It serves as a platform to practice software development practices,
such as git branch management, clean coding principles, and structured documentation.  I hope to strengthen my
hard technical software engineering skills through this project and highlight my skills to future employers.

## Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Stores and displays the last 10 calculations.
- Validates user input to prevent errors like division by zero.
- Provides a simple command-line interface with a menu.

## Setup
- Clone the repository: git clone 
- Open in CLion and ensure CMake is configured.
- Build and run src/main.c.

## Usage
- Enter an operation in the format <operation> <num1> <num2> (e.g., + 5 3).
- usage will be updated as requirements are fleshed out

## Contributing
- This is a personal learning project, but feedback is welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
